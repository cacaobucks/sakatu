I frequently use the sauna to relieve my normal fatigue. I consider [サウナイキタイ([https://sauna-ikitai.com/])]  to be an indispensable tool for sauna lovers. We will analyze the behavior of sauna lovers by collecting data by scraping against the word-of-mouth data of sauna users from the website of such saunas.
 
# possibility
Although the current floor only collects reviews of sauna facilities in specific locations, analysis of data on a larger scale, such as by area or throughout Japan, may eventually clarify sauna users' behavior and rules of thumb.
